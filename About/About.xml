[h1]Different breeds of cats and dogs can reproduce[/h1]
There are so many different species of cat and dogs in this game and its mods. Vanilla Animals Expanded alone adds more more than ten breeds of both species. This makes it difficult to breed these animals, because normally only dogs of the same breed mate.

But since when to dogs care about their care about the breed of their mate?

[b]This mod makes it possible for different breeds of cats, dogs, bunnies, bears, foxes, wolves, hedgehogs, fishers, martens, horses, and platypusses to reproduce.[/b] Half the litter will have the father's breed, half the mother's breed. Currently only viviparous animals can be patched, no egg-laying animals.

Included are patches for: [list]
[*]AnimalCollabProj
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Arid Shrubland
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Australia
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Boreal Forest
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Cats and Dogs
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Ice Sheet
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tropical Rainforest
[*]Vanilla Animals Expanded — Tundra
[*]Let's Have a Cat!
[*]Let's Have a Cat! - Version avoiding duplication with "VAE — Cats and Dogs"
