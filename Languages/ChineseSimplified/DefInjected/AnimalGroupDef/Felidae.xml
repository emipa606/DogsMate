  <Cheetah.label>猎豹</Cheetah.label>
  <!-- EN: The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. Cheetahs typically reach 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3.6 and 4.9 ft). Adults typically weigh between 20 and 65 kg (44 and 143 lb). Its head is small, rounded, and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are recognised. -->
  <Cheetah.description>猎豹（Aquinonyx jubatus）是一种原产于非洲和伊朗中部的大型猫科动物。它是陆地上跑得最快的动物，能以每小时 80 到 128 公里（每小时 50 到 80 英里）的速度奔跑，因此它有几项适应速度的特征，包括轻巧的体型、细长的腿和长长的尾巴。猎豹的肩高通常达到 67-94 厘米（26-37 英寸），头和身体的长度在 1.1-1.5 米（3.6-4.9 英尺）之间。成体体重一般在 20 至 65 千克（44 至 143 磅）之间。它的头小而圆，吻部短，面部有黑色泪痕状条纹。被毛通常呈灰褐色至乳白色或淡灰色，大部分布满均匀分布的纯黑色斑点。目前已确认有四个亚种。</Cheetah.description>

  <Jaguar.label>美洲虎</Jaguar.label>
  <!-- EN: The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large felid species and the only extant member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico in North America, across much of Central America, and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina in South America. Though there are single cats now living within the Western United States, the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and fragmentation of habitat. -->
  <Jaguar.description>美洲虎（Panthera onca）是一种大型猫科动物，也是美洲豹属中唯一原产于美洲的现存成员。美洲虎目前的分布范围从北美洲的美国西南部和墨西哥，横跨中美洲大部分地区，南至南美洲的巴拉圭和阿根廷北部。虽然美国西部现在还有美洲虎，但自 20 世纪初以来，该物种在美国已基本灭绝。世界自然保护联盟红色名录》将其列为近危物种</Jaguar.description>

  <Leopard.label>豹</Leopard.label>
  <!-- EN: The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in Morocco, leopard populations have already been extirpated. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range. -->
  <Leopard.description>豹（Panthera pardus）是现存五种豹科动物之一。它的分布范围很广，包括撒哈拉以南非洲、西亚和中亚的小部分地区、印度次大陆、东南亚和东亚。在世界自然保护联盟红色名录中，金钱豹被列为易危物种，因为金钱豹的数量受到栖息地丧失和破碎化的威胁，在全球大部分地区都在减少。在香港、新加坡、科威特、叙利亚、利比亚、突尼斯以及很可能在摩洛哥，金钱豹的种群已经灭绝。当代的记录表明，金钱豹的分布范围仅占其历史上全球分布范围的 25%。</Leopard.description>
  <!-- EN: lions -->
  <Lion.label>狮子</Lion.label>
  <!-- EN: The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator, although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur, and have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does not. -->

  <SnowLeopard.label>雪豹</SnowLeopard.label>
  <!-- EN: The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), also known as the ounce, is a large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number less than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and subalpine zones at elevations from 3,000 to 4,500 m (9,800 to 14,800 ft), ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, to southern Siberia, Mongolia, and western China. In the countries in the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations. -->
  <SnowLeopard.description>雪豹（Panthera uncia）又称盎司豹，是一种原产于中亚和南亚山脉的大型猫科动物。雪豹在世界自然保护联盟红色名录中被列为易危物种，因为其全球种群数量估计不足 10,000 只，预计到 2040 年将减少约 10%。偷猎和基础设施建设对栖息地的破坏使它受到威胁。它栖息在海拔 3,000 至 4,500 米（9,800 至 14,800 英尺）的高山和亚高山地带，分布范围从阿富汗东部、喜马拉雅山脉和青藏高原到西伯利亚南部、蒙古和中国西部。在其分布区北部的国家，它也生活在海拔较低的地方。</SnowLeopard.description>

  <Tiger.label>老虎</Tiger.label>
  <!-- EN: The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. -->
  <Tiger.description>老虎（Panthera tigris）是现存最大的猫科动物，属于豹属。它最容易辨认的特征是橙棕色皮毛上有深色垂直条纹，底部颜色较浅。它是一种顶级掠食者，主要捕食鹿和野猪等有蹄类动物。它有领地意识，通常独来独往，但也是社会性捕食者，需要大片连成一片的栖息地，以满足捕食猎物和哺育后代的需要。幼虎与母亲在一起生活大约两年，然后才开始独立，离开母亲的家园，建立自己的家园。</Tiger.description>
