  <!-- EN: The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. -->
  <Dog.description>狗（Canis familiaris，如果被认为是一个独立的物种，或者 Canis lupus familiaris，如果被认为是狼的一个亚种）是犬属（犬科）的一个成员，是狼科的一部分，也是数量最多的陆生食肉动物。狗和现存的灰狼是姊妹类群，因为现代的狼与最早被驯化的狼没有密切的亲缘关系，这意味着狗的直系祖先已经灭绝。狗是第一个被驯化的物种，千百年来，人们对狗的各种行为、感官能力和身体特征进行了选择性繁殖。</Dog.description>

  <!-- EN: Vulpes is a genus of the Caninae. The members of this genus are colloquially referred to as true foxes, meaning they form a proper clade. The word "fox" occurs on the common names of species. True foxes are distinguished from members of the genus Canis, such as domesticated dogs, wolves, jackals and coyotes, by their smaller size (5–11 kg) and flatter skull. They have black, triangular markings between their eyes and nose, and the tip of their tail is often a different color from the rest of their pelt. The typical lifespan for this genus is between two and four years, but can reach up to a decade. -->
  <Fox.description>狐属（Vulpes）是犬科的一个属。该属的成员被俗称为真狐，这意味着它们形成了一个适当的支系。狐狸 "一词出现在物种的俗名中。真狐与犬属的成员（如驯养的狗、狼、豺和郊狼）的区别在于它们体型较小（5-11 千克），头骨较扁平。它们的眼睛和鼻子之间有黑色的三角形斑纹，尾巴的尖端通常与皮毛的其他部分颜色不同。该属动物的典型寿命为 2 到 4 年，但也有长达 10 年的。</Fox.description>

  <!-- EN: Hyenas, or hyaenas (from Ancient Greek ὕαινα, hýaina), are feliform carnivoran mammals of the family Hyaenidae. With only four extant species (in three genera), it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia. Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems. -->
  <Hyena.description>鬣狗或hyaenas（源于古希腊语ὕαινα，hýaina），是鬣狗科的猫形食肉哺乳动物。鬣狗科只有四个现存物种（分属三个属），是食肉目中第五小的生物科，也是哺乳纲中最小的科之一。尽管鬣狗的多样性很低，但它们却是非洲大多数生态系统中独特而重要的组成部分。</Hyena.description>

Researchers have suggested that they be considered a separate species, N. viverrinus, or that raccoon dogs of Japan could be further divisible into separate subspecies as N. p. procyonoides (hondo-tanuki, ホンドタヌキ, 本土狸) and N. p. albus (ezo-tanuki, エゾタヌキ, 蝦夷狸), but both views are controversial. -->

  <!-- EN: The dire wolf (Canis dirus, "fearsome dog") is an extinct species of the genus Canis. It is one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores in North America, along with its extinct competitor, the sabre-toothed cat Smilodon fatalis. The dire wolf lived in the Americas during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene epochs (125,000–9,500 years ago). The species was named in 1858, four years after the first specimen had been found. Two subspecies are recognized: Canis dirus guildayi and Canis dirus dirus. The dire wolf probably evolved from Armbruster's wolf (Canis armbrusteri) in North America. The largest collection of its fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. -->
  <Warg.description>地狼（Canis dirus，"可怕的狗"）是犬属中已经灭绝的物种。它是北美洲最著名的史前食肉动物之一，与它已灭绝的竞争对手剑齿猫（Smilodon fatalis）齐名。地狼生活在美洲晚更新世和全新世早期（距今 12.5 万-95 万年前）。1858 年，在发现第一个标本四年后，该物种被命名。目前已确认有两个亚种：Canis dirus guildayi 和 Canis dirus dirus。地狼可能是由北美的阿姆布鲁斯特狼（Canis armbrusteri）进化而来。其最大的化石收藏地是洛杉矶的拉布雷亚沥青坑（Rancho La Brea Tar Pits）。</Warg.description>

  <Wolf.label>狼</Wolf.label>
  <!-- EN: The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the "gray wolf" or "grey wolf", is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). On average, wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 subspecies of wolf have been recognized including the domestic dog. -->
  <Wolf.description>狼（Canis lupus），又称 "灰狼 "或 "灰狼"，是一种原产于欧亚大陆和北美洲的大型犬科动物。它是现存犬科中体型最大的成员，雄性平均为 40 千克（88 磅），雌性为 37 千克（82 磅）。狼的平均体长为 105-160 厘米（41-63 英寸），肩高为 80-85 厘米（31-33 英寸）。狼与其他犬科动物的区别还在于它的耳朵和口部不那么尖，躯干较短，尾巴较长。不过，狼与较小的犬科动物（如土狼和金豺）的亲缘关系很近，可以与它们产生可育的杂交种。狼的带状皮毛通常为白色、棕色、灰色和黑色相间。目前已确认的狼亚种多达 38 种，其中包括家犬。</Wolf.description>
